== Building the linux kernel with C3 support
Our build requires the use of either clang-12 or gcc-12. gcc 12 can easily be installed
from the ubuntu repos as of jammy 22.04LTS using the following command 
    sudo apt-get install gcc-12

Next, rename the linux config file from <repo>/c3_linux.config to .config

Now the linux kernel may be built using normal make commands 

    make CC='gcc-12' 

== Original README:

Linux kernel
============

There are several guides for kernel developers and users. These guides can
be rendered in a number of formats, like HTML and PDF. Please read
Documentation/admin-guide/README.rst first.

In order to build the documentation, use ``make htmldocs`` or
``make pdfdocs``.  The formatted documentation can also be read online at:

    https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/

There are various text files in the Documentation/ subdirectory,
several of them using the Restructured Text markup notation.

Please read the Documentation/process/changes.rst file, as it contains the
requirements for building and running the kernel, and information about
the problems which may result by upgrading your kernel.
